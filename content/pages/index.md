      I'm Hayden- a hardware designer, electronics technician, engineer in
      almost every application, and a full-bred texan.
    subtitle: >-
      After years of soul searching and personal discovery, I've found my
      passion-- making things. When it comes to engineering, there is no one
      principal that I enjoy the most. Making things require many steps.
      Therefore, I never limit myself to one activity.
